# .clangd
#
# this configuration file is for LSP support in editors using clangd
# (Neovim, VSCode with clangd extension, etc.)
#
# purpose: Suppresses false-positive errors that occur due to clangd's
# incomplete understanding of Arduino's build system and header locations.
#
# NOTE: This file does NOT affect compilation - arduino-cli handles that.
# It only improves the development experience in clangd-based editors.
# Feel free to modify or ignore if using different tools.
